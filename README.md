This project involves the analysis and visualization of sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. The datasets `twitter_training.csv` and `twitter_validation.csv` were combined and cleaned to ensure robust analysis. Various visualizations, including bar plots, pie charts, heatmaps, word clouds, and time series plots, were employed to uncover insights into sentiment distribution, topic-wise sentiment, and sentiment trends over time. Insights were revealed into how different topics are perceived and the relationship between tweet length and sentiment, providing valuable information for brands and researchers to better understand and engage with their audience.
